To download this plugin as a zip file click the GREEN code button and select "Download zip" option. Alternatively if you are familiar with git just clone the repository and copy the xml and lua file to your plugins folder.

To install this, I suggest making a subfolder in your plugins folder and unzipping the contents there. Then add it like you would any other plugin.

The miniwindow can be dragged about and can sent to the back or front by right clicking on it.
