To download this plugin as a zip file clivk the GREEN code button and select the zip file option.

To install this, I suggest making a subfolder in your plugins folder and unzipping the contents there. Then add it like you would any other plugin.

The miniwindow can be dragged about and can sent to the back or front by right clicking on it.
